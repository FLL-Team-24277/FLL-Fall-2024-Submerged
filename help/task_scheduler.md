Kids don't regularly pull updated code from github. We tell the kids to do a push at the end of each practice, and we have VS Code set up to do a pull each time they open the program, but sometimes they don't shutdown the program... they just close the laptop. So I like to add a task scheduler to do a pull every day at noon. That way I know they all have the latest code on their laptops at the beginning of practice.

Before you get started, copy the path to the local repository saved on the computer. For example

C:\Github-Projects\Fall-2024-Submerged

You will need that path during the task setup.

![05Action](https://github.com/FLL-Team-24277/FLL-Fall-2024-Submerged/blob/main/help/images/05Action.png)  

Be sure to fill in the path that you copied earlier into the path field
